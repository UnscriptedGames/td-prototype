Tower Defence Prototype Design Brief

Overview
This document outlines the design for a modular, high-performance 2D tower defence game prototype built in Godot 4.4.x using GDScript. The project prioritises code reusability, memory management, and expandability, with placeholder assets and beginner-friendly systems.

1. Map with Single Enemy Path2D
- The main level uses multiple TileMapLayer nodes instead of a static Sprite2D background.
- TileMapLayers allow for painting objects that can be Y sorted and provide more flexible level design.
- Certain tiles have a custom data layer called 'buildable' to determine if a tower can be placed.
- The ghost tower checks if the tile it is above has the buildable property, removing the need for separate collision areas.
- While the ghost tower is active, buildable tiles are visually indicated (e.g., highlighted or outlined) so the player can see where towers can be placed.
- The ghost tower also changes colour depending on whether the location is valid or not.
- Level data is stored in a custom resource file, detailing wave count and enemy spawns.

2. Basic Tower Type
- Towers are Node2D scenes with a container for visuals (Node2D or Sprite2D).
- Range detection uses Area2D and CollisionShape2D (circle).
- The final, placed tower scene does not include buildable area detection.
- All placement logic (checking for buildable area and overlap) is handled by the ghost tower during placement, keeping the placed tower scene clean.
- Tower stats (fire rate, damage, projectile, etc.) are stored in a custom resource file.
- Building uses a ghost tower that follows the mouse, visually shows range, and indicates valid/invalid placement.
- Simple UI button for building towers (to be replaced by card system later).
- Clicking on a built tower visually indicates selection (e.g., outline or highlight), displays the tower's range indicator, and shows a Sell Tower button above the build button. Pressing Sell Tower removes the selected tower from the game.

3. Basic Enemy Type
- Enemies are Area2D scenes with AnimatedSprite2D and CollisionShape2D as children.
- Enemy stats (health, speed, reward, visuals, etc.) are stored in a custom resource file.
- Enemy movement is along a Path2D node in the level, using PathFollow2D for smooth path traversal.
- AnimatedSprite2D uses 2 directions: up-left and down-left. These animations are flipped for up-right and down-right as needed.
- Direction is calculated and mapped to the correct animation, with horizontal flipping as needed.
- Signals for death and reaching the end allow modular game logic.
- Pooling support: enemies reset state when reused.

4. Basic UI
- UI is a CanvasLayer scene with Label nodes for health, currency, and wave.
- UI updates via signals or a singleton managing game state.
- Placeholder fonts and visuals.

5. Placeholder Assets
- Simple shapes or basic sprites for all visuals.
- Assets organised in a clear folder structure (assets/sprites/, assets/sounds/, etc.).
- Subfolders for towers, enemies, UI, and effects.

6. Object Pooling
- Generic object pool system for enemies and projectiles.
- Pools created at game start; objects reused instead of instanced.
- Pooling logic ensures objects reset state on reuse.
- Designed for future expansion (e.g., effects, pickups).

7. Inheritance for Code Reusability
- Base classes for towers, enemies, and projectiles.
- Child classes override only necessary behaviour.
- Signals used for communication to reduce coupling.
- Code and resource files documented for clarity and future expansion.
- Performance and memory management prioritised in all systems.

Structured Approach
1. Set up project folder structure and placeholder assets.
2. Build the main map scene with Sprite2D background, Path2D, and YSort for accents.
3. Implement buildable area detection using Area2D/collision shapes.
4. Create base enemy and tower scenes, with resource files for stats.
5. Set up enemy movement along Path2D and direction-based animation logic.
6. Implement tower placement system with ghost tower and range visualisation.
7. Add basic UI for health, currency, and wave tracking.
8. Integrate object pooling for enemies and projectiles.
9. Ensure all systems use inheritance and signals for modularity.
10. Test and iterate on core gameplay; expand with stretch goals as needed.

Scene Structure
- Main scene: Node2D (root), Sprite2D (background), Path2D, YSort (accents), UI (CanvasLayer), buildable areas (Area2D).
- Enemy scene: Area2D, AnimatedSprite2D, CollisionShape2D.
- Tower scene: Node2D, Sprite2D container, Area2D (range), Area2D (buildable check).
- UI scene: CanvasLayer, Label nodes.

Notes
- All code will follow Godot 4.4.x and provided style guidelines.
- Placeholder assets will be replaced as development progresses.
- Stretch goals (card system, advanced towers/enemies, polish) will be addressed after the prototype is playable.

Game State Management
- Central game state (player health, currency, wave number, etc.) is managed by an Autoload singleton script called GameManager.
- GameManager emits signals (e.g., health_changed, currency_updated) for UI and other systems to listen and update accordingly.
- This pattern ensures robust, decoupled, and scalable game state management throughout the project.

Further Improvement Suggestions
- Use consistent, descriptive node names and scene structures for all major systems.
- Consider adding a dedicated HUD node under UI for all in-game overlays, making it easier to expand UI features later.
- Use custom Resource scripts and .tres files for level, tower, and enemy data to allow easy editing in the Godot inspector.
- Document all custom signals in scripts for clarity and maintainability.
- Add debug toggles and overlays (e.g., show collision shapes, print game state changes) to help during development.
- Organise assets by type and usage from the outset (e.g., assets/towers/, assets/enemies/, assets/ui/, assets/effects/, assets/sounds/, assets/backgrounds/).
- Place placeholder assets in their final intended folders for easy replacement.
- Leave comments or TODOs in the design brief and code for planned future features and stretch goals.
- Profile the game early using Godot's debugger and profiler tools, especially object pooling and signal usage, to catch any bottlenecks before adding complexity.
- Keep the design brief and code comments up to date as the project evolves.
