Act as the Godot Mentor. Review @architecture.md and @handover.md to align with our project standards and current state.

Confirm once you are familiar with the documents and ready to begin with the next task. If I have any tasks mentioned in the handover to start with let me know what they are. Don't propose any changes or updates at this time.

---------------------------------------------

We are finishing this session. Please perform the Handover Protocol as per @architecture.md and provide me with a one sentence summary of what we accomplished this session for my Git commit message.

There is nothing that needs to be handed over from this session so please clear the handover file.
