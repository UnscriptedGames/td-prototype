Act as the Godot Mentor. Review @architecture.md, @handover.md, and @Knowledge/game_brief.md to align with our project standards, current state, and game design vision.

Confirm once you are familiar with the documents and ready to begin with the next task. If I have any tasks mentioned in the handover to start with let me know what they are. Don't propose any changes or updates at this time.

---------------------------------------------

Please review this session's conversations for any design decisions, new ideas, or resolved questions that should be reflected in @Knowledge/game_brief.md or any of the other documents in the @Knowledge folder. Propose specific updates to the brief (additions, modifications, or items moved from "Open Design Questions" to their relevant sections). Do not apply changes — present them for my approval.

---------------------------------------------
