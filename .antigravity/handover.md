# Handover

## Next Session
- Guide the developer through implementing the Turntable tower in Godot. Review
  `Knowledge/tower_design_turntable.md` for the full design spec (visuals, upgrade
  tree, projectile, stats framework).
- Help design and create the required art assets (tower sprites for 4 tiers,
  vinyl record projectile, impact effects).
- First implementation steps: scene architecture, base tower script, targeting
  logic, projectile scene.

## Context
- `Knowledge/towers_brief.md` was created this session — the full 8-tower roster
  design covering archetypes, synergies, and trimming guidance.
- `Knowledge/tower_design_turntable.md` was created this session — the detailed
  Turntable tower design spec (visuals, upgrade tree, projectile, audio/animation
  notes, stat framework).
- `Knowledge/turntable_tiers_reference.png` was saved — concept art showing all
  4 visual tiers of the Turntable tower.
- The Turntable is confirmed as the workhorse tower (Projectile DPS archetype).
- Visual tiers are designed for 64×64 readability: Shape → Colour → Size → New
  element.
- Upgrade system: 3 tiers × 2 choices per tier, shared visuals within each tier.
- Proposed `game_brief.md` updates were presented but not yet applied.
